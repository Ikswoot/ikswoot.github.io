        <h1 id="titleSeneca">Seneca</h1>
        <p>Seneca, in full Lucius Annaeus Seneca, byname Seneca the Younger, (born c. 4 bce, Corduba (now Córdoba), Spain—died 65 ce, Rome [Italy]), Roman philosopher, statesman, orator, and tragedian. He was Rome's leading intellectual figure in the mid-1st century ce and was virtual ruler with his friends of the Roman world between 54 and 62, during the first phase of the emperor Nero's reign.</p>
        <h2 id="titleLife">Early Life and Family</h2>
        <p>Seneca was the second son of a wealthy family. His father, Seneca (Seneca the Elder), had been famous in Rome as a teacher of rhetoric. His mother, Helvia, was of excellent character and education. His elder brother was Gallio, who met St. Paul the Apostle in Achaea in 52 ce, and his younger brother was the father of the poet Lucan. An aunt took young Seneca as a boy to Rome, and there he was trained as an orator and educated in philosophy in the school of the Sextii, which blended Stoicism with an ascetic Neo-Pythagoreanism. Seneca's health suffered, and he went to recuperate in Egypt, where his aunt lived with her husband, the prefect, Gaius Galerius. Returning to Rome about the year 31, he began a career in politics and law. Soon he fell foul of the emperor Caligula, who was deterred from killing him only by the argument that his life was sure to be short.</p>
        <p>In 41 the emperor Claudius banished Seneca to Corsica on a charge of adultery with the princess Julia Livilla, the emperor's niece. In that uncongenial milieu he studied natural science and philosophy and wrote the three treatises entitled Consolationes (Consolations). The influence of Julia Agrippina, the emperor's wife, had him recalled to Rome in 49. He became praetor in 50, married Pompeia Paulina, a wealthy woman, built up a powerful group of friends, including the new prefect of the guard, Sextus Afranius Burrus, and became tutor to the future emperor Nero.</p>
        <p> The murder of Claudius in 54 pushed Seneca and Burrus to the top. Their friends held the great army commands on the German and Parthian frontiers. Nero's first public speech, drafted by Seneca, promised liberty for the Senate and an end to the influence of freedmen and women. Agrippina, Nero's mother, was resolved that her influence should continue, and there were other powerful enemies. But Seneca and Burrus, although provincials from Spain and Gaul, understood the problems of the Roman world. They introduced fiscal and judicial reforms and fostered a more humane attitude toward slaves. Their nominee Corbulo defeated the Parthians; in Britain a more enlightened administration followed the quashing of Queen Boudicca's rebellion.</p>
        <p>But, as the historian Tacitus said, “Nothing in human affairs is more unstable and precarious than power unsupported by its own strength.” Seneca and Burrus were a tyrant's favourites. In 59 they had to condone—or to contrive—the murder of Agrippina. When Burrus died in 62, Seneca knew that he could not go on. He withdrew from public life, and in his remaining years he wrote some of his best philosophical works. In 65 Seneca's enemies denounced him as having been a party to the conspiracy of Piso to murder Nero. Ordered to commit suicide, he met death with fortitude and composure.</p>
        <h2 id="titleWorks">Philisophical Works and Tragedies</h2>
        <p>Of the 10 “Senecan” tragedies, Octavia is certainly, and Hercules Oetaeus is probably, spurious. The others handle familiar Greek tragic themes, with some originality of detail. Attempts to arrange them as a schematic treatment of Stoic “vices” seem too subtle. Intended for play readings rather than public presentation, the pitch is a high monotone, emphasizing the lurid and the supernatural. There are impressive set speeches and choral passages, but the characters are static, and they rant. The principal representatives of classical tragedy known to the Renaissance world, these plays had a great influence, notably in England. William Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus, John Webster's The Duchess of Malfi, and Cyril Tourneur's Revengers Tragaedie, with their ghosts, witches, cruel tyrants, and dominant theme of vengeance, are the progeny of Seneca's tragedies.</p>
        <h2 id="titleLegacy">Stature and Legacy of Seneca</h2>
        <p>Hostile propaganda pursued Seneca's memory. Quintilian, the 1st-century-ce rhetorician, criticized his educational influence; Tacitus was ambivalent on Seneca's place in history. But his views on monarchy and its duties contributed to the humane and liberal temper of the age of the first two Antonines (Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius; 138-180 ce). Meanwhile, the spread of Stoicism kept his philosophy alive, and new horizons opened when it was found to have Christian affinities. There was a belief that he knew St. Paul, and a spurious collection of letters substantiated it. Studied by St. Augustine and St. Jerome, Seneca's works consoled the Christian philosopher Boethius in prison. His thought was a component of the Latin culture of the Middle Ages, often filtered through anthologies. Known to Dante, Chaucer, and Petrarch, his moral treatises were edited by Erasmus; the first complete English translation appeared in 1614.</p>
        <p>In the 16th to 18th century, Senecan prose, in content and style, served the vernacular literatures as a model for essays, sermons, and moralizing. John Calvin, Montaigne, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau are instances. As the first of “Spanish” thinkers, he had an influence in Spain that was always powerful. Nineteenth-century specialization brought him under fire from philosophers, scientists, historians, and students of literature. But interest aroused by the bimillenary commemorations of his death in Spain in 1965 and later scholarly work heralded a Senecan revival starting in the last decades of the 20th century. In his 40 surviving books, the thoughts of a versatile but unoriginal mind are expressed and amplified by the resources of an individual style.</p>
